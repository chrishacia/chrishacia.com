This is nothing more than my own litte personal web site, nothing too special here. Not as far as I am concerned. Just wanted to share it with those who are interested from a coding perspective.
This is also me learning Angular at the same time, so, apologies if this isn't done 100%. Please point it out to me. I always welcome feedback!
